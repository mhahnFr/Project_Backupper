# Welcome to the Project_Backupper!
This repository contains a project I made in 2017. It is an application that
creates a backup of the registered folders in the specified folder. It requires
a Java runtime environment in version 9 or higher.

## Idea
The initial ide of this project was to build an application, that creates a
backup of the registered files in the specified location. Only the files and
folders that have changed should be copied over, the other files should be
linked to the previous backup. Additionally, the application should be able to
create backups using the local network.

## Approach


### Final notes
This project is in a working state, and might be updated in the future.
